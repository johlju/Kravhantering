# HSA Person Lookup Adapter

This test and integration-support image exposes the repository-owned
`POST /hsa/person-records/lookup` REST contract and translates one accepted
request to SOAP `GetHsaPerson`.

The only business listener is HTTPS on `8443`. Startup requires the complete
strict tuple for both legs:

- `HSA_ADAPTER_INGRESS_CERT_PATH`, `HSA_ADAPTER_INGRESS_KEY_PATH`,
  `HSA_ADAPTER_INGRESS_CA_PATH`, and the exact
  `HSA_ADAPTER_INGRESS_EXPECTED_CLIENT_SUBJECT` for Kong-to-Adapter ingress;
- `HSA_SOAP_ENDPOINT_URL`, `HSA_SOAP_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`,
  `HSA_SOAP_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`, `HSA_SOAP_CA_PATH`, and the exact
  `HSA_SOAP_TLS_SERVER_NAME` for Adapter-to-HSA egress.

Each role bundle is provisioned before startup and mounted read-only. The
runtime has no plaintext business listener, optional authentication mode,
certificate generator, CA signing key, live reload, or TLS-validation bypass.
Loopback `127.0.0.1:8081/health` is the separate local health endpoint.

The Adapter forwards the App-generated UUID correlation identifier as the SOAP
message identifier and logs only the identifier and a stable event name. SOAP
payloads and HSA person data are never logged. Invalid requests and upstream
TLS or SOAP failures return bounded REST outcomes without raw diagnostics.

Run the component contract with:

```bash
npm --prefix containers/hsa-person-lookup-adapter test
```

The dependency stage uses the digest-pinned public UBI 10 Node.js 24 builder;
the runtime uses the matching minimal role. Builds require no Red Hat account
or subscription. Builder npm follows this directory's `packageManager` and
lockfile. The shared `containers/node/ubi-compat.sh` adaptation preserves the
`1000:1000` identity and removes the runtime npm CLI; inherited nodemon remains.
The Dockerfile explicitly resets inherited S2I defaults and keeps
`node src/strict-server.mjs` as the direct command. Existing init supervision,
read-only roots, temporary mounts and administrative `--user=0:0` overrides
remain supported. No additional runtime packages are required.

Run the actual-image contract after building or loading the complete image:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```bash
KRAVHANTERING_HSA_ADAPTER_IMAGE=localhost/kravhantering/hsa-person-lookup-adapter:local \
  npx vitest run tests/container-integration/hsa-person-lookup-adapter.test.mjs
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The image contract exercises REST-to-SOAP lookup, bounded upstream failures,
health separation, both mTLS boundaries, role-bundle isolation, containment and
signal behavior. It runs only when the image variable is set. The adapter stays
in the separate HSA integration-support lock, outside the production topology.
Release verification must scan and exercise the exact final candidate archive;
a component-image pass does not replace the installed production smoke.

The required deployed topology, negative identity matrix, and rotation tests
live in `containers/hsa-mtls-topology/`.
